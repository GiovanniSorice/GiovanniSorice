## Hi there, nice to meet you ðŸ‘‹

I am an Artificial Intelligence student at the University of Pisa and I am **currently working on my Master Thesis about the detection of Trending Topics in news**.  
My strengths are algorithms and problem-solving. Usually, I try to understand things rather than memorize them, which is harder but leads to greater knowledge of the subject. For this reason, I decided to focus on Artificial Intelligence in which mathematics and probabilistic reasoning are fundamentals.

#### What is a Junior Enterprise?
It's a **no-profit association of students** with the main goal of practise what we are studying.  
The concept, as described also in [JE Website](https://juniorenterprises.it/en/), is very simple: `"A Junior Enterprise gives students the opportunity to put their theoretical knowledge into practice through the realization of projects and studies required by companies, institutions or individuals."`
